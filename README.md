"# DeliveryInventoryService" 

Project goal: Build a Delivery Management System (DMS) to route parcels end-to-end using heterogeneous vehicles and multiple warehouses, prioritizing minimum time and minimum cost.

Vehicle types to support: FOUR_WHEELER, AUTO, PICKUP, TRAIN, BUS, MOTORCYCLE (bike/last-mile).

Schedule constraints: Support fixed-date/time schedules for TRAIN and BUS (and optionally scheduled trucks), including capacity per schedule (units/weight).

Routing decision goals: Select vehicles and routes that optimize for a weighted combination of minimal delivery time and minimal cost while respecting availability, capacity, and schedules.

Hub-and-spoke flow: Vehicles will transport aggregated parcels to warehouses (regional hubs); after arrival, MOTORCYCLE riders perform last-mile deliveries and collections.

Collection flows: Bike riders will collect parcels from sellers and deliver to the origin warehouse (seller pickup).

Batching logic: Provide logic to aggregate city parcels into warehouse batches and decide how many warehouse hops a parcel should take before reaching the customer.

Real-time tracking: Use Kafka for streaming location tracking from vehicles and riders; use Redis (or equivalent) for fast proximity queries and PostGIS for persistent geo storage.

Event-driven architecture: All critical lifecycle changes (assignment, departure, arrival, exceptions) must be published to Kafka topics with schemas managed in a schema registry.

APIs & integrations: Provide REST endpoints for order placement, vehicle onboarding, assignment planning, routing estimates, and tracking; provide WebSocket endpoints for live dashboards.

Optimization algorithms: Implement multi-criteria scoring for vehicle selection (time, cost, availability) and a CVRP solver or heuristic (Clarke-Wright + 2-opt) for last-mile route planning.

Failure & reassignments: Implement dynamic re-assignment flows: detect delays via location stream, re-run planner, and re-assign shipments; ensure atomic assignment confirmation and compensating transactions.

Data model: Define entities for Vehicle, VehicleSchedule, Driver, Warehouse, Order, Parcel, Shipment, Route, and LocationEvent with industry-standard fields and geospatial indices.

Message contracts: Define Kafka topics (location.events, assignment.commands, shipment.events, etc.) and sample JSON/Avro schemas for each.

Storage & indexing: Use PostgreSQL + PostGIS for authoritative data and Redis GEO for fast nearest-vehicle queries; partition time-series tables by date.

Security & compliance: Use OAuth2/JWT with RBAC, TLS for all services, encryption at rest, and PII minimization; keep audit logs for dispatch decisions.

Observability: Add Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, Jaeger traces, structured logs, and alerts for vehicle offline, shipment delays, and assignment failures.

Scalability & performance: Design for horizontal scaling of Kafka consumers and assignment service; ensure assignment decisions in a few seconds and location ingestion processed sub-second.

MVP & roadmap: Deliver minimal viable features first (orders, vehicle onboarding, location stream, simple assignment, last-mile), then add schedule-aware long-haul, advanced routing, and ML-based improvements.

Deliverables: API specs, ER diagrams, Kafka schemas, scoring algorithm pseudocode, CI/CD pipeline, test plan (unit/integration/load), and deployment manifests (Helm/Terraform).

Configurable business rules: Expose config for weights of time vs cost, distance thresholds for vehicle preference (e.g., prefer AUTO for 30â€“40 km), max hops, and service-level time windows.

Edge cases: Define handling for schedule cancellations, vehicle breakdowns, partial deliveries, returns, and capacity overbook situations.

Tech choices (suggested): Kafka, PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Redis, REST, schema registry for Kafka, external routing provider (Google/OSRM) with caching.
